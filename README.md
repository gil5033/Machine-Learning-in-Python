# Machine-Learning-in-Python
This repository is dedicated to demonstrating some very powerful algorithms in the machine learning world and how they apply to the financial world

Many of these python programs require the installation of some non-standard libraries. In order to run, these libraries must be downloaded

These programs also use data that is stored within the Data.zip folder. It is important to change the os.chdir() command to fit where you extracted this zip file to. In my case, these files were stored in "C:\Users\Franster\Desktop\Computer Shit\Code\Python Code\Machine Learning\Data"

To install talib on anaconda use: "conda install -c masdeseiscaracteres ta-lib"
